read matrix A, vector b

if matrix A is square then
	get the bigger element of the column in absolute value
	row changes to put the bigger elements on the diagonal
	get multipliers for each column
	row operations to put zeros below the diagonal
	get augmented matrix A.b
	solve the equation to get xn with regresive sustitution on the augmented matrix

else
	matrix isn't square
