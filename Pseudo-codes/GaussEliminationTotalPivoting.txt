read matrix A, vector b

if matrix A is square then
	get the bigger element of each submatrix of matrix A
	row changes to put the bigger element on the diagonal
	get multipliers for each column
	row operations to get zeros below the diagonal
	get augmented matrix A.b
	solve the equation to get xn with regresive sustitution on the augmented matrix

else
	matrix isn't square
