read tolerance, x0, iteration-number

while error > tolerance and count < iteration-number and fx not equals 0 and f'x not equals 0
	
	get the succession with the formula xn = x0 - (fx / f'x)
	evaluate the function and the derivative with the formula
	error = |xn -x0|
	x0 = xn

if fx == 0
	x0 is a root

else if error <= tolerance
	x0 is an approximation with tolerance tolerance

else if f'x == 0
	xn is a possible multiple root
	
else
	maximum iterations
